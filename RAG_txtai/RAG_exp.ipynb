But if you are going to find what you were meant to do, you will have to act anyway. What I am trying to say here is that a calling takes work. Finding yours will require a fear-facing journey that will last a lifetime. And where does it begin? With awareness. With discovering what your life is already saying to you. And as you attempt to uncover this mystery, consider one more question, a much more constructive one: What happens if you don’t do this? That’s what should really scare you. Your Life Is Speaking Many people wander through life, unaware of their purpose, blindly following the whims of the world. To them, those who reach their potential seem to possess an extraordinary gift. But what if pursuing your calling wasn’t a luxury reserved for the elite? What if it was required to live life, fully alive? Where would you start? Listen to your life. That’s Frederick Buechner’s advice. An author who spent part of his life as a schoolteacher and another part as a minister, he observed that finding your vocation is less about grand moments of discovery and more about a habit of awareness. “See it for the fathomless mystery it is,” he wrote. “In the boredom and pain of it no less than in the excitement and gladness: touch, taste, smell your way to the holy and hidden heart of it because in the\" \n",

But the truth is, in some ways, it’s already come. You already have some sense of what you’re supposed to do with your life, even if you aren’t sure what it is. The trick is to find your vocation hidden in your life. That’s what I learned the moment I started thinking of myself as a writer. I went looking for answers and found that some of them were already in me. We all want to “just know” what we’re supposed to do with our lives, for our purpose to be spelled out for us, but that’s not how a calling works. It’s never clear and hardly ever obvious, especially when you’re starting out. But when you start to take those first steps, when you commit to some course of action, you begin to see what was there all along. Most of us have some sneaking suspicion that there must be more to life than this . We understand we each have a part to play in a bigger story. Even if we aren’t sure what that is, we know there’s something . Those “lucky” few who find their callings testify to this. They knew there was a purpose out there, and they were determined to find it. The way that they did this was by taking the first step, by overcoming the myth that “you just know” and deciding to act anyway. And they learned, as you might, an important lesson: clarity comes with action. At a certain point, you must acknowledge this nudge, the hint of a whisper that says life has been holding out on you.\" \n",

The Seven Stages and Accompanying Lessons (Chapter Summary) 1. Awareness: Before you can tell your life what you want to do with it, you must listen to what it wants to do with you. 2. Apprenticeship: Every story of success is a story of community. Although mentors are hard to come by, accidental apprenticeships are everywhere. Your life is preparing you for what’s to come. 3. Practice: Real practice hurts. It takes not only time but intentional effort. But some things do come naturally. Be open to learning new skills, and watch for sparks of inspiration to guide you. 4. Discovery: Don’t take the leap; build a bridge. You never “just know” what you’re supposed to do with your life. Discovery happens in stages. 5. Profession: Failure is your best friend.
